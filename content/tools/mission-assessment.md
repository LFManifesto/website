Every drone mission requires a feasibility assessment. This trainer gives you the complete data package and asks whether the mission is a GO or NO-GO.

You get four data sources for each scenario. The CloudRF report shows your C2 link margin. Above 15 dB is nominal, 10-15 dB is marginal, below 10 dB is critical. The METAR gives you current weather including wind, visibility, and cloud ceilings. NOTAMs tell you about temporary flight restrictions and airspace issues. The ADS-B summary shows nearby traffic.

Reference guides are available if you need help decoding METAR format or understanding NOTAM syntax.

After reviewing everything, make your call. The debrief explains why the mission was feasible or not, highlighting which data point was the deciding factor.

Scenarios cover urban mapping, autonomous delivery, emergency response, rooftop inspection, and nighttime surveillance.
