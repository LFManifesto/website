Before the Air Team launches, someone needs to assess the site. This trainer puts you through realistic scenarios where you evaluate RF conditions, physical hazards, and C2 link budgets to make a GO/NO-GO call.

Each scenario gives you a mission briefing, the drone type being used, and the C2 link budget at the target area. You get a visual site description and an RF scan table showing detected signals with frequency, power level, and identification.

Your job is to identify the most critical interfering signal, assess whether the link margin is sufficient, check for GPS jamming, evaluate physical hazards, and make a final recommendation.

The trainer covers sites in Atlanta, Columbus, and near military installations. RF environments are realistic, based on what you'd actually see in those locations.
