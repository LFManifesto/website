When you're shooting through a window, port, or any small opening, your bullet doesn't travel where your crosshair points. At close range to the aperture, the combination of your scope height and dialed elevation creates a gap between your line of sight and the bullet's actual path.

This calculator tells you exactly where that gap is and whether you'll clear the obstacle.

Enter your height over bore, distance to the loophole, the elevation you've dialed for your target, and the size of the opening in mils. The calculator gives you a GO/NO-GO and tells you where to hold.

The visual display shows your sight picture with the aperture and bullet path overlaid, updating as you change inputs.

There's also a range estimation tab for mil-based calculations and a unit conversion tab for the inevitable metric/imperial confusion.
