The Light Fighter Manifesto Podcast launches January 2026. Hosted by Chris and Meli, episodes run about 15 minutes and drop bi-weekly.

Each episode focuses on a single topic. Emerging technologies reshaping unconventional warfare. Guerrilla operations and light fighting ethics. Privacy tools and secured communications. Mesh networking and decentralized infrastructure. Community project updates and what we're working on.

No filler, no hour-long rambles. We pick a topic, break it down, and move on.

The RSS feed goes live with the first episode. Subscribe in your podcast app of choice. We're also submitting to Apple Podcasts and Spotify.
