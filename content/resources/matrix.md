Matrix is a decentralized communication platform. Unlike Discord, no single company controls it. Your account can communicate with anyone on any Matrix server worldwide.

## Quick Start

**Already have a Matrix account?** Skip to [Join Our Community](#join-our-community).

## Step 1: Create a Matrix Account

You need a Matrix account from any server. We recommend matrix.org (free, reliable).

### On Desktop

1. Go to [app.element.io](https://app.element.io)
2. Click **Create Account**
3. Keep "matrix.org" as your homeserver
4. Choose a username and password
5. Complete email verification

### On Mobile

1. Install **Element** from your app store:
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/element-messenger/id1083446067)
   - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app)
   - [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app/)
2. Open Element and tap **Create Account**
3. Keep "matrix.org" as your homeserver
4. Choose a username and password
5. Complete email verification

## Step 2: Join Our Community

Once you have an account, join our General room:

### Option A: Direct Link

Click this link or paste it into Element's search:

**[#General:matrix.lightfightermanifesto.net](https://matrix.to/#/#General:matrix.lightfightermanifesto.net)**

### Option B: Manual Search

1. In Element, click the **+** or **Explore** button
2. Enter: `#General:matrix.lightfightermanifesto.net`
3. Click **Join**

## What to Expect

After joining #General, introduce yourself. An admin will invite you to topic-specific rooms based on your interests:

- **Unmanned Systems** - Drones and unmanned platforms
- **Long Range Precision** - Marksmanship and optics
- **Communication Platforms** - Comms and mesh networking

Active contributors may be invited to project rooms for LFM development work.

## Why Matrix?

- **Decentralized** - No single point of control or failure
- **Federated** - Communicate across servers (like email)
- **End-to-End Encrypted** - Private conversations stay private
- **Open Source** - Auditable code, no hidden backdoors
- **Censorship Resistant** - No corporate policies deciding what you can discuss

## Alternative Clients

Element is recommended, but Matrix works with many clients:

- **Desktop**: [Element](https://element.io/download), [Nheko](https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/nheko), [FluffyChat](https://fluffychat.im)
- **Mobile**: [Element](https://element.io/download), [FluffyChat](https://fluffychat.im), [SchildiChat](https://schildi.chat)
- **Terminal**: [gomuks](https://github.com/tulir/gomuks), [iamb](https://github.com/ulyssa/iamb)
- **Web**: [Element](https://app.element.io), [Cinny](https://cinny.in)

## Important Note

Do NOT try to create an account on matrix.lightfightermanifesto.net directly. Our server is federated but does not host user accounts. Use matrix.org or any other public Matrix server.
