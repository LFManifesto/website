We ditched the GoDaddy template site. It was limiting what we could do, and frankly, it looked like every other tactical blog with a Punisher skull and a "sheep dog" motto.

The new site runs on Hugo. Static files. No database. No WordPress with seventeen plugins and a prayer. Just HTML served from a CDN that doesn't care who you are.

More importantly, we've minimized tracking. No Google Analytics watching you read about counter-surveillance. No Facebook pixels. No advertising scripts phoning home to servers you've never heard of.

The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. They provide basic analytics—page views, countries—but they don't use cookies or track you across the web. The irony of hosting a privacy-focused site on infrastructure that respects privacy is not lost on us.

## What Changed

The podcast gets its own section now. Embedded players. Proper RSS feed. When we launch in January, subscribe in whatever app you use. We don't care which one.

The shop accepts Monero directly. No middleman. No payment processor logging your purchase. Send XMR to the wallet address, email us your order, and we ship it. The way transactions should work.

We added an apps section. The interactive tools and calculators from the zines now live on the site where they're easier to access and update. No more PDFs. No more screenshots of tables you can't read on your phone.

## What We Cover

Emerging technologies reshaping unconventional warfare. That's the short version.

The longer version: guerrilla operations in the age of drones and mesh networks. Privacy and secured communications when the surveillance state has sixty thousand cameras pointed at you. Electronic warfare fundamentals that don't require a security clearance to understand. The ethics of operating in contested environments when the lines between war and peace have been erased.

We're not a gear review site. We don't chase trends or regurgitate manufacturer press releases. The content comes from practitioners exploring what works in the field, not what looks good on a range day.

Expect discussions on decentralized infrastructure, autonomous systems, protocols that work when the grid doesn't, and the gray zones where technology meets operational art.

We'll get into the weeds. That's where the useful information lives.

## Get Involved

The Discord has grown to nearly 4,000 members. Military. Law enforcement. Security researchers. People who take preparedness seriously without making it their personality.

For secure comms, we run a Matrix server. Same conversations. Different protocol. Choose whichever threat model fits your situation.

Welcome to the new site.

Same mission. Better infrastructure.

Let's get to work.
