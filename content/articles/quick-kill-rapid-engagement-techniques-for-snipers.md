You are in a stairwell. The railing is cold under your hand and the building smells like pigeon shit and old rain.

Somewhere in this building is a window. Somewhere beyond that window is a man crossing a courtyard. He popped hot on a drone thermal feed ninety seconds ago. Your radio crackled with his whereabouts. You started climbing.

He does not know you are coming. He is thinking about his next cigarette, or the letter he will write tonight, or nothing at all.

Your heart is running somewhere north of 140 beats and you can feel it in your throat.

By the time you reach that window and find something stable to shoot from, you will have maybe ten seconds to read the shot and take it. After that he will be gone.

There is no time to pull out a rangefinder. No time to reference the dope card in your sleeve pocket. You will see what your reticle tells you and you will either press the trigger or you won't.

## The Problem

The old way was patience. You low-crawled into a hide. You waited. Sometimes for hours. Sometimes for nothing. When the shot came, it was almost a relief. The end of all that careful stillness.

That sniper still exists. He is just becoming extinct.

In Ukraine, drones account for eighty percent of the casualties. The battlefield is transparent from above, saturated with cheap drones and cheaper munitions. Infantry holds ground and spots for the robots.

But there are places drones cannot see. The covered approach. The space between buildings where the angle is wrong. The urban seams.

In these spaces, the sniper matters. But only if he can work at the speed the fight demands.

TC 3-22.10, the Army's sniper manual, defines overmatch as creating "an unfair fight in favor of the sniper." It does not say anything about taking your time.

What follows are three ways to solve those problems fast enough to matter.

---

## Danger Space

You are providing overwatch for a ground element. They are moving through a village and you are on a rooftop 400 yards south with a clear line on the main road. Anything that presents itself between you and them needs to die quickly.

The question is how to engage targets at unknown distances without stopping to range each one.

The answer is danger space.

Before the mission, you study your area of operation (AO). Buildings, open areas. You determine that 400 yards is your longest anticipated engagement.

The bullet rises. Then it falls. At some point between muzzle and target, it reaches its highest point above your line of sight. That is max ordinate. If the bullet never rises higher than your target is tall, you can hold on the base and hit anything from muzzle to max range.

One hold. Every target. Every distance inside the envelope.

{{< danger-space >}}

The table shows what happens. At close range, the bullet is still rising. At max ordinate, it peaks. At max range, it drops back to your point of aim. All hits.

This is not precision shooting. This is killing fast. The target appears, you put the crosshair on his belt, you press the trigger. No thinking. No math.

For sniper teams, you can break the AO into sectors. Near, mid, far. Different shooters dialed to different ranges. Layered fires. Interlocking danger spaces. Nobody has to calculate anything when the shooting starts.

## Max Point Blank Zero

The concept is the same. Find a zero that keeps the bullet inside a targets torso for as long as possible. For a 30-inch target, the bullet never rises more than 15 inches above your line of sight or falls more than 15 inches below.

For 7.62 NATO at standard velocities, that zero falls around 400 yards. Dial it. Now, from muzzle to approximately 480 yards, you can hold center of visible mass and hit somewhere on a standing man.

At 50 yards, you hit slightly high. At 400 yards, you hit point of aim. At 480 yards, you hit low, but still on the target. Beyond that, the bullet drops below the kill box and you need to start holding over.

The difference from danger space: MPBZ optimizes for maximum range coverage when you do not know where the threat will appear.

## Wind Width

Now you need to figure out the wind.

The traditional method is this: read the vegetation, read the mirage, estimate velocity at the target, velocity at midrange, velocity at the muzzle, average them, multiply by your wind factor, apply the hold.

This works. It also takes time you might not have.

Target width in wind reframes the question. Instead of asking *how fast is the wind*, ask *how much wind error can I tolerate and still hit*.

The table below shows it. At 400 yards, your target is 14 mph wide. You can misjudge the wind by that much, hold the upwind edge, and still put the round somewhere on the torso. At 800, the target is 3 mph wide. Your margin shrinks fast.

{{< wind-width >}}

This is not a wind call technique. It is risk assessment. You read conditions, estimate velocity, favor the upwind edge, then ask: is my margin wide enough to cover my uncertainty?

If yes, shoot. If no, hold till conditions change or move closer.

## The Integration

These techniques layer.

Danger space handles the known AO. One hold, beltline, everything from muzzle to max range. Press and forget.

MPBZ handles the unknown. Moving through unfamiliar terrain or on infil, dial your far zero, hold center mass, engage anything inside the envelope without thinking.

Wind width runs underneath both. You already know your margins from the table. At 400 you have 14 mph to play with. At 800, three. When you estimate a 5 mph crosswind, you know instantly whether you are gambling.

None of this replaces fundamentals. You still need a stable position. You still need a clean trigger press. You still need to call your shot and know when you have missed and how to correct it for a follow up shot.

But the cognitive overhead compresses. The math, the lookups, the second-guessing. It all becomes pattern recognition you can run without stopping to think.

---

## The Tempo

In the treelines around Bakhmut, Ukrainian snipers talk about a fight that looks nothing like the manuals. Positions are occupied for minutes or hours, not days. Drones overhead force constant movement. Targets appear on thermal feeds for seconds before disappearing behind walls or before they go underground.

The sniper who hesitates watches opportunities vanish. The sniper who cannot operate at tempo becomes a liability. He occupies a position a drone could fill. He consumes resources without producing effects.

The human behind the glass has to justify his presence by doing what the machines cannot.

Move fast. Shoot fast. Displace before the counterbattery fires.

---

You are at the window now. Third floor. You have been climbing for forty-five seconds and your heart rate is still high. The bipod legs are on the sill and your breathing is wrong and none of that matters because there he is, crossing the courtyard, exactly where they said.

You already dialed 2.3 mils before you stepped off. Danger space. Everything out to 400 yards is within your kill box. 

He is inside that.

Beltline. Press.

Through the glass you watch him buckle. Knees hit the ground first. Then the rest of him.

You are already moving. Rifle up, off the sill, down the stairs three at a time. Your shot signature is blooming on someone's thermal right now. Counter-battery could be inbound. If you are still in this building in thirty seconds, you will not be leaving it.
