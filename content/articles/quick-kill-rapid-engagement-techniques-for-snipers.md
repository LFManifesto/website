You are halfway up a stairwell you have never climbed before. The building is abandoned, or close to it—concrete block walls, metal railing cold under your support hand, dust floating in the light slanting through a broken window two floors up.

Your heart rate is somewhere north of 140. You can feel it in your neck.

Somewhere above is a position. Somewhere beyond that position is a target who appeared on thermals ninety seconds ago, moving through a courtyard 370 meters east. He will not stay visible. He never does. By the time you reach the window, settle into something resembling a stable platform, and find him in your scope, you will have seconds to break the shot or he will be gone.

There is no time to range with a laser. No time to reference a card. No time to wait for your spotter to call wind. You will see the target, read what your reticle tells you, and either make the shot or watch the opportunity disappear.

This is what sniper employment looks like now.

## The Problem

The old image of the sniper—patient, methodical, crawling into a carefully constructed hide to wait hours or days for the perfect shot—is not wrong. It is just incomplete.

Modern conflicts have compressed the engagement timeline. In Ukraine, drone-delivered munitions account for an estimated eighty percent of casualties. Infantry assaults in the traditional sense have become rare; soldiers describe their role as holding ground and spotting for UAVs rather than maneuvering to contact. The battlespace has been flattened by cheap precision from above.

But there are places drones cannot see. Covered approaches. Interior spaces. Dense vegetation. The seams between buildings in urban terrain. In these spaces, the sniper still matters—but only if they can operate at the tempo the fight demands.

TC 3-22.10 defines overmatch as the sniper "applying their learned skills, employing their equipment, leveraging technology, and applying the proper force to create an unfair fight in favor of the sniper." The manual does not say anything about taking your time.

The problem, always, comes down to two variables: range to target and wind. Everything else is mechanics. What follows are three techniques that solve for those variables faster than traditional methods allow.

## Max Point Blank Zero

Here is a scenario. You have a rifle zeroed at 100 meters. A target appears at 340 meters. What is your hold?

If you are reaching for a range card or trying to remember your drop at that distance, you are already too slow. The target is moving. By the time you have the number, he is behind cover.

Max Point Blank Zero eliminates this problem by exploiting a basic fact of external ballistics: a bullet does not fly in a straight line. It arcs—rising above the line of sight as it leaves the muzzle, then falling back through it at the zero distance, then dropping below as it continues downrange.

MPBZ sets the zero at a distance where the bullet's arc stays within a target-sized window for as long as possible. If you are shooting at a target 30 inches tall—roughly head to belt line on a standing man—and you zero so the bullet never rises more than 15 inches above your line of sight, and never falls more than 15 inches below it, you can hold center mass and hit the target at any distance from muzzle to the far edge of that arc.

No holdover. No math. Just put the crosshair where you want the bullet and press.

The calculation requires ballistic software, but the concept is simple: find the zero distance where max ordinate (the highest point of the bullet's arc above line of sight) equals half your target height. That gives you two zeros—a close one where the rising bullet crosses your line of sight, and a far one where the falling bullet crosses it again. The far zero is your MPBZ.

For a 7.62 NATO round at standard velocities shooting at a 30-inch target, typical values look like this:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Target height | 30 inches |
| Max ordinate | 15 inches |
| Close zero | 25 meters |
| Far zero (MPBZ) | 365 meters |
| Max point blank range | 440 meters |

That last number is the critical one. Out to 440 meters, you can hold center mass on a torso-sized target and expect a hit. Beyond that, the bullet drops below the target and you need to start thinking about holdovers again.

The tradeoff is precision. MPBZ optimizes for speed, not accuracy. You are aiming center mass, not center of a specific organ. At longer ranges within the envelope, you may hit low chest instead of upper chest. For target interdiction, this is usually acceptable. For a hostage rescue headshot at 200 meters, it is not.

Know what you are giving up when you use it.

## The 12-Inch Drill

MPBZ works until it does not—until the target is beyond your max point blank range, or you need more precision than a center-mass hold allows, or the situation has changed and you need a specific holdover right now.

This is where the 12-inch drill comes in.

The technique exploits a constant: the distance from the top of a human head to the top of the shoulders is approximately 12 inches. So is the distance from the bottom of the chin to the center of the chest. These dimensions are stable across most adult males, regardless of height or build.

To use it, you mil the 12-inch span on your target. A head-to-shoulders measurement reading 0.7 mils tells you the target is at approximately 435 meters. But you do not need to know the range in meters—what you need is the holdover in mils.

For a 7.62 rifle running M118LR or equivalent at roughly 2,600 feet per second, the math collapses to a simple rule: **the mil reading plus the holdover equals ten.**

You read 0.7 mils. What plus 0.7 equals 10?

Three.

Hold 3 mils high and break the shot.

| Mil reading (12") | Approximate range | Holdover |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 305 m | 0 mils |
| 0.9 | 340 m | 1.0 mils |
| 0.8 | 380 m | 2.0 mils |
| 0.7 | 435 m | 3.0 mils |
| 0.6 | 510 m | 4.0 mils |
| 0.5 | 610 m | 5.0 mils |
| 0.4 | 760 m | 6.0 mils |

The numbers are approximations. Your specific rifle, ammunition, and conditions will shift them. But the principle—mil a known dimension, apply a simple formula, take the shot—collapses what would otherwise require a rangefinder, a card, and math under stress into a three-second process that happens entirely through your optic.

Note the tradeoff: accuracy degrades at distance. The rule of 10 is tuned for a specific velocity band, and it assumes you are reading 12 inches correctly. A target in a crouched or unconventional posture breaks the assumption. You are trading precision for speed.

This is acceptable when speed matters more. That is your call to make.

## Target Width in Wind

You have the range. Now you need the wind call.

Traditional methods involve reading indicators—vegetation, dust, mirage—and estimating wind velocity in miles per hour at various points along the bullet's flight path. This works. It also requires practice, experience, and cognitive bandwidth that may not be available when your pulse is hammering and the target is about to move.

Target width in wind offers an alternative frame: instead of asking "how fast is the wind blowing," you ask "how much wind would it take to miss?"

The calculation starts with your 1 mph wind value—the amount of deflection, in mils, caused by a 1 mph crosswind at a given range. Ballistic software generates this, or you can build a table in advance. For M118LR at 800 meters, the 1 mph wind value is approximately 0.23 mils.

Now measure your target in mils. A torso at 800 meters might read 0.57 mils wide.

Divide the target width by the 1 mph wind value:

0.57 ÷ 0.23 = 2.5

That number is the target's width in mph. It means you can misjudge the wind by up to 2.5 mph—aiming at the upwind edge—and still hit somewhere on the target.

| Range | 1 mph wind value | 18" target width (mph) |
|---|---|---|
| 400 m | 0.11 mils | 4.1 mph |
| 600 m | 0.17 mils | 2.9 mph |
| 800 m | 0.23 mils | 2.5 mph |
| 1000 m | 0.30 mils | 1.9 mph |

Look at what the table tells you. At 400 meters, you have over 4 mph of margin. You can be substantially wrong about the wind and still connect. At 1000 meters, you have less than 2 mph of margin. The target is functionally smaller in wind terms, even though its physical dimensions have not changed.

This reframes the wind call from an abstract estimation problem to a risk assessment. You read the conditions, make your best guess, and then ask: is my margin wide enough to cover my uncertainty?

If the answer is no, you hold. If the answer is yes, you shoot.

## Integration

These techniques are not mutually exclusive. They layer.

MPBZ handles the easy shots—targets inside your point blank envelope that need to go down now. You do not think; you index and fire.

The 12-inch drill picks up where MPBZ ends. Target beyond the envelope? Mil the head-to-shoulders, apply the formula, hold the correction. Faster than cards, almost as fast as point-blank work.

Target width in wind runs in the background. You have already built the table. You know that at 600 meters your margin is about 3 mph, at 800 it is about 2.5. When you read the conditions and estimate 5 mph from the right, you know whether you are inside your margin or gambling.

None of this replaces fundamentals. You still need a stable position. You still need a clean break. You still need to call your shot and know when you have missed. But the cognitive overhead—the math, the lookups, the second-guessing—compresses into patterns you can run at speed.

The fight in that stairwell will not wait for you to think. The bullet will fly or it will not. Your job is to make sure the thinking happened before you ever started climbing.

## The Tempo

In the forests around Bakhmut and the rubble of Avdiivka, Ukrainian snipers describe a fight that looks nothing like the patient stalks of doctrine. Positions are occupied for hours, not days. Drones overhead force constant displacement. Targets appear in thermals for seconds before finding cover, and the sniper who hesitates watches them disappear.

The old skills still matter. Reading terrain, building hides, waiting—none of that goes away. But the ability to make a fast, accurate shot when the opportunity arrives has become the difference between relevance and irrelevance.

The sniper who cannot operate at tempo becomes a liability. They occupy a position a drone could fill. They consume resources without producing effects. In a fight where eighty percent of casualties come from unmanned systems, the human behind the glass has to justify their presence by doing what the drones cannot.

Move fast. Shoot fast. Displace before the counterbattery fires.

The techniques in this article are tools for that fight. MPBZ eliminates math in close. The 12-inch drill provides math at distance. Wind width turns estimation into risk management. Together, they compress the shot process to the point where a sniper moving through unfamiliar terrain can make the hit without stopping to think.

The window is closing. The target is moving. You have three seconds.

What you do with them is up to you.
