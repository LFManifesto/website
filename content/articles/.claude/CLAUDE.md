# LFM Article Writing Guide

**Last Updated:** December 12, 2025
**Parent Context:** `/Users/user/Claude-Work/Projects/www.lightfightermanifesto.org/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

This document establishes the baseline format and style for all Light Fighter Manifesto articles.

---

## Article Structure

### Front Matter

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title: Subtitle if Needed"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: "Compelling 1-2 sentence hook. Should make reader want to click."
author: "LFM"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
draft: false
---
```

### Required Sections (in order)

1. **Hero Image** - Full-width image at top
2. **Historical Anchor Opening** - 2-4 paragraphs establishing context through history
3. **Volume Attribution** - Credit original LFM Volume source with author handle
4. **Body Sections** - Content with `##` headers, `---` dividers between major sections
5. **Closing Section** - Returns to opening thread (closes the loop)
6. **Sources** - All references, no inline links in body
7. **Tools** - LFM apps first, then external resources

---

## The Voice

We write like the bastard offspring of the New York Times, Hemingway, and Chuck Palahniuk. Elegant authority with dry humor underneath. Short sentences that carry weight.

### Core Rules

1. **Historical anchor opening** - Start with a historical figure/event that illuminates the topic (Hannibal for medicine, Simo Häyhä for sniping, Bentham for surveillance)

2. **Short sentences.** Periods over em-dashes. Fragment sentences for punch.

3. **No fluff words.** Kill "basically," "essentially," "actually," "very," "just."

4. **No inline links.** All links go in Sources/Tools sections at the end.

5. **Imply, do not explain.** Trust the reader's intelligence.

6. **Use "do not" instead of "don't"** for weight and authority.

7. **Dry humor, not jokes.** ("does not ask for hazard pay," "bad news: there is homework")

8. **Current data with verified sources.** Research external sources, do not rely solely on Volume material.

9. **Forward-looking timeframe.** Frame content for 2026 and beyond.

10. **Close the loop.** Final section returns to opening historical anchor.

### Sentence Rhythm

Mix long explanatory sentences with short punchy ones:

> The FBI operates more than 120 surveillance aircraft registered to shell corporations with post office boxes in Bristow, Virginia. Most are single-engine Cessna 182T Skylanes, fitted with exhaust mufflers to reduce engine noise, flying at approximately 5,000 feet. The cameras resolve individual faces on the ground.

Fragment sentences for emphasis:

> Concrete block. Soviet era. Cold railing.

### What NOT to Do

- Second-person present tense openings ("You are in a stairwell...")
- Inline hyperlinks in body text
- Emojis
- Exclamation points
- "Basically," "essentially," "actually," "very," "just"
- Em-dashes where periods work better
- Explaining what the reader should feel

---

## Volume Source Attribution

When expanding content from LFM Volumes, always:

1. **Name the source** in the opening section:
   > In Light Fighter Manifesto Volume III, disruptor_26 ([@Sentinel_Society](https://instagram.com/Sentinel_Society) / [@Disruptor26](https://instagram.com/Disruptor26)) introduced...

2. **Weave direct quotes throughout** the article:
   > disruptor_26 wrote about the medic needing to keep "a library of voodoo and supporting philosophies" in their head.

3. **Include in Sources section**:
   > - Light Fighter Manifesto Volume III: "Guerrilla Hacking for Austere Medicine" (disruptor_26, 2023)

### Author Attribution Format

| Volume | Author | Handle Format |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Vol III | disruptor_26 | ([@Sentinel_Society](https://instagram.com/Sentinel_Society) / [@Disruptor26](https://instagram.com/Disruptor26)) |
| Vol III | N. | (no public handle) |
| Vol IV | LFM (self) | Do NOT reference "the editor" - use "Volume IV" directly |

**IMPORTANT:** For Volume IV content, we are the editor. Do not write "the editor described..." as it reads awkwardly. Instead:
- Use: "Volume IV documented..."
- Use: Direct quotes without attribution
- Use: "Volume IV called it..."

---

## Research Requirements

Articles MUST include external research beyond Volume source material:

### Required Research Depth

- **Statistics** - Current data with dates (2024-2025)
- **Legal cases** - Court rulings, lawsuits, precedents
- **Market data** - Industry size, growth projections
- **Technical specifications** - Verified capabilities, limitations
- **Organizational data** - Agency programs, contract values, deployments

### Source Quality Hierarchy

1. **Primary sources** - Court filings, government reports, official documentation
2. **Investigative journalism** - ACLU, EFF, BuzzFeed News investigations, 404 Media
3. **Academic papers** - BMJ, peer-reviewed journals
4. **Industry sources** - Company documentation, Wikipedia for factual data
5. **News reporting** - For recent events, verified by multiple outlets

### Research Before Writing

Always search for:
- "[topic] 2024 2025" for current data
- "[topic] lawsuit court ruling" for legal precedents
- "[topic] statistics market size" for quantitative data
- "[technology] capabilities limitations" for technical accuracy

## Readability and Pacing

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Word Count** | 1,800-2,500 | ~7-10 minute read |
| **Flesch Reading Ease** | 50-65 | Higher = easier; 30-50 is "difficult" |
| **Grade Level** | 10-11 | Appropriate for educated adults |
| **Avg Sentence Length** | 10-15 words | Short sentences maintain LFM punch |
| **Difficult Words** | <25% | Some technical jargon unavoidable |

### Sentence Length Rules

1. **Break up sentences over 30 words.** If a sentence requires a breath to read aloud, split it.

2. **Vary rhythm.** Mix short punchy sentences (5-10 words) with medium explanatory ones (15-20 words).

3. **Technical sentences need simplification.** If explaining a complex concept:
   - Break into multiple sentences
   - Lead with the simple version, then add detail
   - Example: "The baseband processor handles all cellular communication. This chip operates below the operating system. You cannot control it."

### Patterns to Avoid

**Jargon stacking** - Do not pile technical terms in one sentence:
```
BAD:  "IMSI-catchers, cell-site simulators, and Stingrays force IMEI/IMSI identification via
       rogue BTS spoofing."
GOOD: "These devices mimic cell towers. Your phone connects automatically. It gives up its
       unique identifier without you knowing."
```

**Run-on explanations** - Break up compound sentences:
```
BAD:  "Originally developed for battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan under the program name
       'Gorgon Stare,' these systems use multiple advanced sensors to detect and track every
       vehicle and individual moving within an entire city-sized area simultaneously."
GOOD: "The military developed these under the program name 'Gorgon Stare' for battlefields
       in Iraq and Afghanistan. Multiple sensors track every vehicle and person moving within
       an entire city. Simultaneously."
```

**Passive constructions with long modifiers:**
```
BAD:  "The growth is driven by demand from police departments, intelligence agencies, and
       national security operations."
GOOD: "Police departments, intelligence agencies, and national security operations are all buying."
```

### Section Pacing

1. **Vary section patterns.** Do not repeat: intro → quote source → statistics → legal challenge for every section.

2. **Insert action vignettes.** Break up exposition with narrative moments (the stairwell scene, the robot rescue).

3. **Front-load the interesting parts.** The first 150 words determine if readers continue.

4. **Tighten closings.** Do not re-summarize the entire article. Trust readers got it.

### Redundancy Checks

Before publishing, search for:
- Repeated phrases (Ctrl+F the source name - if it appears 6+ times, vary attribution)
- Concepts explained twice in different sections
- Closing sections that restate body content

---

## Section Formatting

### Headers

```markdown
## Section Title

Content here.

---

## Next Section
```

Use `---` horizontal rules between major sections for visual breathing room.

### Blockquotes for Direct Quotes

```markdown
The editor's assessment was blunt: "The state, with its vast resources, has built a near-perfect system for monitoring public gatherings."
```

### Technical Data

For calculations or technical examples, use the site's shortcodes:

```markdown
{{< worked-example title="DANGER SPACE CALCULATION" >}}
Content here
{{< /worked-example >}}
```

### Resource Callouts

```markdown
{{< resource-callout title="INTERACTIVE MAP" url="https://example.com" icon="map" >}}
Description of resource.
{{< /resource-callout >}}
```

---

## Sources Section Format

```markdown
### Sources

- BMJ Military Health: "'Golden day' is a myth" (Dilday et al., November 2024)
- ACLU: FBI surveillance aircraft fleet documentation
- Light Fighter Manifesto Volume III: "Article Title" (author, year)
```

**Rules:**
- Publication/Organization first
- Article title in quotes
- Author and date in parentheses
- No URLs in Sources (those go in Tools)

---

## Tools Section Format

```markdown
### Tools

- [LFM App Name](/apps/app-path/) - Brief description
- [External Tool](https://url.com/) - Brief description
```

**Rules:**
- LFM apps listed first
- External tools after
- Brief description (one line)
- Verify all links work before publishing

---

## Hero Images

### Format

```html
<figure class="hero-image">
  <img src="/images/articles/article-slug/hero.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text">
</figure>
```

### Requirements

- Store in `/static/images/articles/[article-slug]/`
- Use descriptive alt text
- Prefer .jpg for photos, .png for graphics
- No SVG for hero images (Safari compatibility)

---

## Tags

### Common Tags

| Category | Tags |
|----------|------|
| Medical | Medicine, TCCC, Austere Medicine, Prolonged Field Care |
| Weapons | Marksmanship, Sniper, Tactics |
| Tech | Drones, FPV, SIGINT, Electronic Warfare, Reticulum |
| Intel | OSINT, Surveillance, Counter-Surveillance, Tradecraft |
