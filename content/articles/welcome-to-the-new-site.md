We ditched the GoDaddy template site. It was limiting what we could do, and frankly, it looked like every other tactical blog out there.

The new site runs on Hugo, a static site generator. Pages load fast because there's no database, no WordPress bloat, and no server-side processing. Just HTML files served from a CDN.

More importantly, we've minimized tracking. No Google Analytics, no Facebook pixels, no third-party advertising scripts. The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, which provides basic analytics (page views, countries) but doesn't use cookies or track individual users across the web.

## What Changed

The podcast gets its own section now with embedded players and a proper RSS feed. When we launch in January, you'll be able to subscribe in whatever app you use.

The shop accepts Monero directly. No middleman, no payment processor logging your purchase. Send XMR to the wallet address, email us your order, and we ship it.

We also added an apps section. Interactive tools and calculators from the zines now live on the site where they're easier to access and update.

## What We Cover

The Light Fighter Manifesto focuses on emerging technologies reshaping unconventional warfare and the modern light fighter. We cover guerrilla operations, privacy and secured communications, mesh networking, and the ethics of operating in contested environments.

We're not a gear review site. We don't chase trends or regurgitate manufacturer press releases. The content comes from practitioners exploring what works in the field, not what looks good on a range day.

Expect discussions on decentralized communications infrastructure, autonomous systems, electronic warfare fundamentals, and the gray zones where technology meets operational art. We'll get into the weeds on protocols, tradecraft, and the strategic implications of emerging tech.

## Get Involved

Join the Discord if you want to talk shop. The community has grown to nearly 4,000 members across military, law enforcement, security research, and preparedness backgrounds.

For secure comms, we run a Matrix server. Same conversations, different protocol.
